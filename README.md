Most email MCP servers only do IMAP reads. This one does **everything**: read, search, send, reply, forward, bulk operations, Microsoft Graph API, and Exchange Web Services — with real OAuth2, multi-account, and multi-provider support. Written in Rust for speed and safety.

## What's New in v0.4.9

- **New tool `imap_get_attachment` — download a single attachment to disk.**
  Until now the only ways to reach attachment bytes were `imap_get_message`
  (which returns attachment *metadata* and optional extracted PDF *text*, never
  the binary) and `imap_get_message_raw` (capped at 1 MB and base64-encoded
  into the response). A 7 MB email with X-ray images could not be retrieved at
  all — over the cap, and dumping it into the response would blow up the model's
  context anyway.
- **How it works:** call `imap_get_attachment` with the `message_id` plus a
  selector — either `part_id` (the value `imap_get_message` reports for each
  attachment) or `filename`. The server fetches the full message (no size cap on
  the server side), extracts and decodes just that one part, and **writes it to
  disk**, returning `{ file_path, filename, content_type, part_id, size_bytes }`.
  The binary never enters the response, so context stays small. The saved path
  feeds straight into a local reader (e.g. an image-description tool or a PDF
  reader).
- **Where files land:** `output_dir` argument if given, else the
  `MAIL_ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOAD_DIR` environment variable, else the system temp dir.
  Filenames are sanitized (basename only, control characters stripped) to
  prevent path traversal, and prefixed with the message UID and part id to avoid
  collisions.
- **Optional inline base64:** set `include_base64: true` to also get the bytes
  in the response, but only when the attachment is at most `max_inline_bytes`
  (default 256 KiB). Off by default.

## What's New in v0.4.8

- **`SAVE_SENT` is now per-account with a provider-aware default.**
  Previously, saving a copy of outgoing mail to the Sent folder via IMAP
  APPEND was controlled by a single global flag, `MAIL_SMTP_SAVE_SENT`. The
  problem: providers that **already save** sent mail server-side (Gmail,
  Zoho) ended up with **two identical copies** in Sent, while a generic SMTP
  server or Office 365 (which do **not** auto-save on SMTP submission) lost
  the copy entirely when the flag was `false`.
- **Provider-aware default** (when nothing is configured):
  - **Gmail** (`smtp.gmail.com`): saves server-side and deduplicates by
    Message-ID → the MCP does **not** append (`false`).
  - **Zoho** (`smtp.zoho.com`): saves server-side but does **not**
    deduplicate → the MCP does **not** append (`false`), avoiding the
    duplicate.
  - **Office 365 / generic SMTP**: do **not** auto-save on SMTP submission →
    the MCP **does** append (`true`), or the sent copy would be lost.
- **Per-account override**: `MAIL_SMTP_<ID>_SAVE_SENT=true|false` takes
  priority over everything. The global `MAIL_SMTP_SAVE_SENT` still works as a
  coarse override (wins over the provider default, loses to the per-account
  override).
- Precedence: **per-account** → **global** → **provider-aware default**.

| Provider | Auto-saves server-side | MCP default |
|---|---|---|
| Gmail | Yes (with dedupe) | `false` |
| Zoho | Yes (no dedupe) | `false` |
| Office 365 (SMTP) | No | `true` |
| Generic SMTP / relays | No | `true` |

## What's New in v0.4.7

- **Critical fix — `graph_send_message` silently dropped attachments on
  threaded replies.** When called with `in_reply_to` + `attachments`, the
  `createReply → PATCH → send` flow included the attachments in the PATCH
  against `/me/messages/{id}`. Microsoft Graph treats `Message.attachments`
  as a navigation property and **silently discards the field** on PATCH
  (2xx response, no error), so the message went out as single-part
  `text/html` with no file. The MCP returned `status: ok` and the caller
  assumed success. Invisible data loss.
- **The fix:** in `send_via_reply()`, attachments are now uploaded one by one
  to `POST /me/messages/{draft_id}/attachments` between the PATCH and the
  send. Files < 3 MB go inline (JSON with base64 `contentBytes`); files
  ≥ 3 MB use `createUploadSession` with 4 MB chunked PUTs. The `attachments`
  field was removed from the `PatchDraftRequest` struct so the regression
  cannot be reintroduced by a type-correct edit.
- **No change to flows that already worked.** `send_via_sendmail` (new
  messages without `in_reply_to`) uses `POST /me/sendMail` with `attachments`
  inline in the JSON — Graph DOES accept the field on that endpoint and never
  dropped it. That path is untouched.
- **Regression test added:** `patch_draft_request_never_serializes_attachments`
  fails if anyone re-adds the field to the struct.
- **Reference:** `BUG_GRAPH_ATTACHMENTS.md` at the repo root documents the
  full reproduction, root cause, and the empirical evidence behind the fix.

## What's New in v0.4.6

- **Server-side enforcement of HARD RULE #1.** Three releases of prompt-only
  hardening (v0.4.3 → v0.4.4 → v0.4.5) still left LLMs occasionally leaking
  literal `</body_text><parameter name="body_html">` markup into the
  recipient's inbox. v0.4.6 adds a real validator that **rejects** the tool
  call before any SMTP / Graph / EWS attempt if `body_text` or `body_html`
  contains tool-call wrapper syntax. The check is wired into all 5 send
  paths (`smtp_send_message`, `smtp_reply_message`, `smtp_forward_message`,
  `graph_send_message`, `ews_send_message`).
- The forbidden markers are case-insensitive and tightly scoped — only
  the pseudo-tags that have no legitimate use in human correspondence:
  `<body_text>`, `</body_text>`, `<body_html>`, `</body_html>`,
  `<function_calls>`, `</function_calls>`, `<invoke name=`, `</invoke>`,
  and `<parameter name="body_*">`. Generic technical content that happens
  to mention `<parameter>` for an XML schema or `<invoke>` in a code
  example still passes.
- **HARD RULE #1 wording updated** to announce the server-side rejection,
  so the LLM knows it's a hard contract — not a suggestion it can ignore.
- No breaking changes for clean callers: well-behaved messages send
  exactly as before.

## What's New in v0.4.5

- **`serverInfo` now reports `name="mail-mcp"` + the crate `version`** (the
  framework previously returned its own `rmcp 0.16.0`, which never changes
  between releases). Useful for verifying the active version with `/mcp`, and
  so any client-side cache keyed by (server, version) invalidates on each bump.
- **MCP instructions reorganized**: the 3 critical anti-concatenation rules
  (which in v0.4.3 and v0.4.4 sat at the end of the block and could be lost
  to truncation / diluted attention) now appear as **HARD RULE #1, #2, #3 at
  the TOP**, right after the title. Consolidated into 3 short paragraphs
  (previously 3 long sections, ~1500 characters combined).
- **No functional changes to the server.** Same SMTP/IMAP/EWS/Graph, same
  tool set, same behavior. Only the text exposed to the client changed.

### Important for these rules to take effect

Clients that resume a session with `claude --continue` (or `/resume`) do
**NOT** refresh the MCP `system_prompt` — they keep the one from that
session's first handshake. If your session predates v0.4.5, the rules won't
reach your context even if the on-disk binary is updated. To receive them,
start a NEW session in the project (not `--continue`).

## What's New in v0.4.4

- **Preview hygiene rule** in MCP `instructions`: when the LLM shows the
  user the email preview before sending, it should render ONE clean
  version of the body (markdown-style bullets, bold, links as text + URL)
  and state that the message will go multipart — but it must NOT dump
  the raw HTML source (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<a href>`...) into the
  preview. Two reasons:
  1. The human reviewer wants to read the message, not audit markup —
     showing the HTML is noise.
  2. Exhibiting both the plain-text string AND the HTML string side by
     side in the preview is exactly the context that has historically
     led LLMs to concatenate them in the eventual tool call (the bug
     v0.4.3 documented). Hiding the HTML source from the preview
     removes the temptation.

  Complements the **PREVIEW DOES NOT EQUAL TOOL CALL** rule introduced
  in v0.4.3.

## What's New in v0.4.3

- **Server-side guidance against malformed tool calls.** The MCP
  `instructions` block now explicitly tells the calling LLM that
  `body_text` and `body_html` are TWO SEPARATE JSON fields and must
  NEVER be concatenated. Previous wording ("send BOTH body_text AND
  body_html") was ambiguous and some LLMs interpreted it as "concatenate
  both with `<body_text>...</body_html>` pseudo-tags inside a single
  `body_text` string". When that happens, the recipient sees garbled
  duplicated content, AND any later Claude session that opens the saved
  copy via this MCP gets a Usage Policy block (the leaked
  `<invoke>...</invoke>` looks like a prompt-injection attempt to safety
  filters). The new instruction shows a CORRECT vs WRONG example and
  bans pseudo-tags / tool-call wrapper syntax inside email fields.

## What's New in v0.4.2

- **Release pipeline fixed**: the `publish-npm` job in the CI release
  workflow has been disabled. It was inherited from the upstream fork and
  tried to publish to `@bradsjm/mail-imap-mcp-rs`, a scope this org does
  not own — every release was 404-ing on that step. See "Releasing" below
  for the full explanation and how to re-enable npm publishing if needed.
- **Auto-trigger releases on tag push**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  now fires on `push: tags: ['v*']`, so tagging `vX.Y.Z` and pushing is
  all it takes to cut a release. `workflow_dispatch` is retained as a
  manual escape hatch.
- **Cleanup**: removed the dangling `init-npm-placeholder.yml` workflow
  (also referenced the fork's npm scope).
- **docs**: README gains a "Releasing" section documenting the new flow
  and the npm decision.

## What's New in v0.4.1

- **Fix**: `save_to_sent_folder` now archives the exact RFC822 bytes that were
  sent (via `lettre.formatted()`), instead of a hand-rolled text-only stub.
  The Sent-folder copy keeps the HTML body, the multipart/alternative
  structure, and the RFC 2047-encoded subject — no more `???` where accents
  used to be, and HTML is no longer silently dropped.
- **Improved**: localized Sent-folder detection — `Enviado[s]`, `Elementos
  enviados`, `Enviadas`, `Itens enviados`, `Envoyés`, `Éléments envoyés`,
  `Gesendet`, `Posta inviata`, `Verzonden`, `Wysłane`, plus nested variants.
  Previously only English names were recognized, so Zoho/localized IMAP
  accounts fell through to a non-existent `"Sent"` folder.
- **Improved**: `smtp_forward_message` accepts `body_html` (was hardcoded to
  plain-text only).
- **Improved**: EWS send gains `bcc`, `in_reply_to`, `references` (via
  `<t:InternetMessageHeaders>`), plus full recipient + subject-length
  validation — now at parity with the SMTP and Graph send paths.
- **Improved**: Graph API threading fallbacks now log. `WARN` when the
  message-lookup HTTP call fails (rate limit, 5xx, permissions) so operators
  see threading degraded due to a real error; `DEBUG` when the original
  message is legitimately not found.
- **Refactor**: EWS XML parsing migrated from substring matching to
  `quick-xml`. Fixes a latent namespace-collision bug (`<soap:Body>` vs
  `<t:Body>`), correctly decodes XML entities and CDATA, and handles
  attribute values containing `=` (common in base64-like EWS item IDs).
- **Cleanup**: zero warnings on `cargo build --release`.
- **Tests**: 64 (up from 47).

## Quickstart — Let Claude Code do it

Copy and paste this prompt into Claude Code and it will install, compile, and configure everything for you:

```
Install and configure the mail-mcp MCP server from https://github.com/tecnologicachile/mail-mcp

1. Clone the repo, build with cargo build --release
2. Add the MCP server to .claude.json with the binary path
3. For Microsoft accounts: use EWS (simplest) — run device code flow with
   client_id d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c and scope
   https://outlook.office365.com/EWS.AccessAsUser.All offline_access
   Then configure MAIL_EWS_<ID>_USER and MAIL_EWS_<ID>_REFRESH_TOKEN
4. For Gmail: configure MAIL_IMAP + MAIL_SMTP with App Password from
   https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
5. For Zoho: configure MAIL_IMAP + MAIL_SMTP with standard password
6. Enable write/send: MAIL_IMAP_WRITE_ENABLED=true, MAIL_SMTP_WRITE_ENABLED=true

My email accounts to configure:
- <your-email@example.com>
```

Replace the last line with your email(s). Claude Code will guide you through each step including the OAuth2 device code flow for Microsoft accounts.

## Manual Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tecnologicachile/mail-mcp.git
cd mail-mcp
cargo build --release
```

Add to your MCP client config (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mail": {
      "command": "./target/release/mail-mcp",
      "env": {
        "MAIL_IMAP_DEFAULT_HOST": "imap.gmail.com",
        "MAIL_IMAP_DEFAULT_USER": "you@gmail.com",
        "MAIL_IMAP_DEFAULT_PASS": "your-app-password",
        "MAIL_SMTP_DEFAULT_HOST": "smtp.gmail.com",
        "MAIL_SMTP_DEFAULT_PORT": "587",
        "MAIL_SMTP_DEFAULT_USER": "you@gmail.com",
        "MAIL_SMTP_DEFAULT_PASS": "your-app-password",
        "MAIL_SMTP_DEFAULT_SECURE": "starttls",
        "MAIL_IMAP_WRITE_ENABLED": "true",
        "MAIL_SMTP_WRITE_ENABLED": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Your AI agent can now read, search, send, reply, and manage emails.

### Microsoft Account? Use Graph API

Microsoft blocks SMTP on personal accounts. Use Graph API instead:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "MAIL_IMAP_DEFAULT_HOST": "outlook.office365.com",
    "MAIL_IMAP_DEFAULT_USER": "you@hotmail.com",
    "MAIL_IMAP_DEFAULT_PASS": "your-app-password",
    "MAIL_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_PROVIDER": "microsoft",
    "MAIL_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID": "9e5f94bc-e8a4-4e73-b8be-63364c29d753",
    "MAIL_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET": "none",
    "MAIL_OAUTH2_DEFAULT_REFRESH_TOKEN": "<your-token>"
  }
}
```

Get your token in 1 minute with device code flow. See [Account Setup Guide](docs/account-setup.md).

### Attachments

Send files with any send tool. Two modes:

```json
// Large files — MCP reads from disk (recommended)
"attachments": [{"file_path": "/path/to/report.pdf"}]

// Small files — inline base64
"attachments": [{"filename": "note.txt", "content_type": "text/plain", "content_base64": "SGVsbG8="}]
```

Filename and MIME type are auto-detected from the file path. Reply with `include_original_attachments: true` to forward original attachments.

**Downloading** an attachment from a received message: use `imap_get_attachment`
with the `message_id` and a `part_id` (from `imap_get_message`) or `filename`.
It writes the decoded file to disk and returns the path — no size cap, and the
binary stays out of the response. Set the default download directory with
`MAIL_ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOAD_DIR` (falls back to the system temp dir), or pass
`output_dir` per call.

## Releasing

Releases are automated via [`cargo-dist`](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist). To ship a new version:

1. Bump `version = "X.Y.Z"` in `Cargo.toml` (the release workflow enforces
   that this matches the pushed tag).
2. Commit the bump + any release notes to `main`.
3. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin main --tags
   ```
4. The `push: tags: ['v*']` trigger in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   compiles binaries for Linux / macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) / Windows,
   generates installer scripts (`.sh`, `.ps1`), creates the GitHub Release,
   and attaches all artifacts with SHA256 checksums.
5. If anything fails you can re-run the workflow manually from the Actions
   tab (the `workflow_dispatch` trigger is preserved as an escape hatch).

**npm publishing is intentionally disabled.** The upstream fork was
configured to publish as `@bradsjm/mail-imap-mcp-rs`, a scope this
organization does not own, which caused every release to 404 on `npm
publish`. The npm tarball is still generated and attached to each GitHub
Release so users can install via `npm install ./mail-mcp-npm-package.tar.gz`
manually. To enable npm registry publishing for this fork: create an npm
org (e.g. `@tecnologicachile`), configure Trusted Publishing on
npmjs.com pointing at this repo, set `publish-jobs = ["npm"]` in
`dist-workspace.toml`, and run `dist generate --allow-dirty` to restore
the `publish-npm` job in `release.yml`.
